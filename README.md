## Frontend Technologies
* React
* Some kind of Flux framework, undecided which one
* Possibly immutable.js (I'd like to use immutable data as much as possible - where it makes sense)
* WebSockets
* WebRTC (maybe - there's no iPhone support, so it's lower priority)
* Radium (for CSS)
* Babel (transpiling)
* jspm (package management)
